Advika and Nika - Project 4 - GardenLand

1. To trigger the event, click on the screen on any spot, preferably near the trees.
2. Once clicked, a magical tulip garden will appear.
3. Once the dudeNotFull walks into the garden, the dude will transform into a garden gnome.
3. The garden gnome will now have the job of planting sunflowers near the trees, so he will go to the nearest tree and plant a flower in front of it.
4. Once the garden appears, new butterfly entities will also spawn. They will fly around and eat the flowers that the gnome is planting.

New Classes Added:
 1. Gnome - subclass that extended Dude just like dudeFull and dudeNotFull
 2. Butterfly - completely new entity that extends Movable.
 3. Flower - subclass that extended Plant similar to sapling.

Choices:
1. Advika - responsible for transforming the Dude into a gnome and planting flowers
2. Nika - responsible for creating butterflies and making them eat the flowers.

Design Decisions:
1. We couldn't decide where to put the transform methods because at first we wanted both the dudeFull and dudeNotFull to transform.
We thought of writing one common method and putting it within Dude so that it would be inherited by everyone.
2. We decided to keep the transform method abstract in the Dude class, so that DudeFull, DudeNotFull, and Gnome would implement a version of it.
We realized we only wanted the DudeNotFull to do the transformation, so we couldn't move the method up.
